# British_Airways_Predict_customer_buying_behaviour
**Summary for GitHub:**

In this project, I have developed multiple machine learning models to predict customer buying behavior for British Airways. The models were built and evaluated using Python in a Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab.

The dataset was preprocessed and features were engineered to optimize model performance. Four different classifiers were trained and compared:

1. Model 1: Random Forest Classifier with the top 6 features
2. Model 2: Random Forest Classifier with all features
3. Model 3: XGBoost Classifier with the top 6 features
4. Model 4: XGBoost Classifier with all features

After thorough experimentation and analysis, the final model achieved an accuracy of 85.09%. Additionally, the model's area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC score) was calculated to be 0.5577, indicating its ability to distinguish between positive and negative cases.

The code, data preprocessing steps, feature engineering techniques, model training, and evaluation processes are all available in the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository. This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be utilized to predict customer behavior, enabling businesses like British Airways to make data-driven decisions and optimize their marketing and customer engagement strategies.

Feel free to explore the notebook and the code to gain insights into the methodology and techniques used to achieve the final predictive model. Please refer to the documentation within the notebook for a more comprehensive understanding of the project and the steps taken to achieve the results.
